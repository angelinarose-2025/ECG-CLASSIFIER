#Overview
This project implements an AI-based ECG classifier that analyzes ECG signals to automatically detect normal vs abnormal heart rhythms.
It uses a deep learning model (CNN / RNN / Transformer) trained on ECG datasets to learn distinguishing patterns in heartbeat signals.

##Key Features:

Preprocessing pipeline for denoising & normalization

End-to-end training and inference

Outputs class probabilities (normal / abnormal)

Modular code to support more arrhythmia types
